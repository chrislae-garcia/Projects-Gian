# Pyro-Hydro-Cryo Project

This project is an altered version of the 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' game. Instead of using the generic attacks, this project uses three elements from the game [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/game).

About the elements:
 - <b>Pyro</b> is associated with fire, which is <em>effective against <b>Cryo</b></em> but <em>ineffective against <b>Hydro</b></em>.
 - <b>Hydro</b> is associated with water, which is <em>effective against <b>Pyro</b></em> but <em>ineffective against <b>Cryo</b></em>.
 - <b>Cryo</b> is associated with ice, which is <em>effective against <b>Hydro</b></em> but <em>ineffective against <b>Pyro</b></em>.
